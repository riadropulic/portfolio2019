            My name is Ria DropuliÄ‡, 20 years old student from Croatia. I moved
            to Denmark one and a half years ago in order to study and develop my
            career and the field of ux, ui design as well as in front end
            development.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout the first semester at Copenhagen school of Design and
            Technology I gained a lot of knowledge regarding all fields included
            in the subject areas of the matter. During the projects I was mostly
            responsible for the design and concept, I would be a backup for the
            coding but I participated actively in all parts of the assignments.
            My experiences at KEA gave me knowledge and encouraged me even more
            to develop myself both personally and professionally as a multimedia
            designer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Besides school I am usually away from Denmark, busy traveling and
            visiting places while expanding my professional network around the
            world.
