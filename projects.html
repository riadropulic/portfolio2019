          During my attendance at multimedia design and communications, I gained
          knowledge in these four main areas of studies in the first semester.
          Below you can find the links to each subject area and take a look at
          the projects I made during the last five months.

              After only two weeks of attending the program, we were given an
              assignment which was based on making the very basic website. As
              the name says itself it was required to design it for the mobile
              version layout. Each one of us was given a specific style that the
              page had to describe both content and design wise.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was given the POP ART style, I was quite excited about it and
              even though the final product was not exactly what I was hoping to
              make it was a great experience to see what I have learned after
              only three weeks of studies.

              In the second theme of the semester, we got introduced to the
              basics of animations. We started by learning about animations in
              CSS by using keyframes. After some time of practicing it was time
              for learning about JavaScript. For the few upcoming projects, we
              used JavaScript as the first group project we had to animate the
              scene from some of the given famous movies.
            </p>
            <p>
              First time of working in the group in my case did not go so well
              and we failed the assignment, which thought me a lot about group
              work and organisation for the upcoming projects. You can check out
              the animated character I made for one of the assignments in the
              link.

              Probably the most fun theme for me was the basic content. I
              enjoyed learning about concept development, recording videos,
              film, and dramaturgy in media elements as well as editing
              techniques. As a film lover, I found it fun to work with
              PremierePro and do some acting for the first assignment of the
              theme. In a very limited amount of time, we had to tell a story in
              two minutes without speaking. It was important how we used the
              composition of the image and angles to show dramaturgical
              elements. We came up with a funny love story in the library. The
              second assignment was more complexed, the final product was an
              informative web page about cycling in Denmark. Our target group
              were tourists and young people who just moved to the country.

              For the first time, we used the design sprint method in a group
              project. The theme consisted of two assignments of which the first
              one was based on making the final coded prototype and the second
              one resulted with making a prototype of a native app. Design
              sprint seemed to be intense in the begging, in five days we came
              up with the prototype after considering a lot of our different
              ideas and opinions. This prototype was individually coded later
              on. <br />
              We ended the semester with our final project in which we made a
              prototype for an app that would help us improve the experience of
              the global welcoming week of the Copenhagen school of design and
              technology. The app was developed by focusing on the idea of
              helping the environment with reducing the paper usage as during
              this week a lot of paper is used to provide much different
              information for the participants.
